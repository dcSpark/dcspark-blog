been a lot of growth in use-cases that require frequent message signing in the crypto ecosystem - primarily driven by NFTs and gaming. However, a lot of users lose interest when they realize how tedious it will be to accept the prompt by their wallet every time they have to sign a message<br/><br/>\\n\\nAs the authors of original Cardano message signing spec (CIP8: https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip8/), we are very familiar with the cryptography involved in message signing. We are planning to release a layer on top of this message signing system to more easily allow wallets to auto-sign messages in cases where it knows it is safe to do so. Although we will create a more formal specification, you can find the initial approaches discussed in the following document: [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VqXjyfgvbXxYHqhzYcSFFEorYbnza6GbjyAbVXyAKAM/edit?usp=sharing)<br/><br/>\\n\\nNotably, a lot of the power of this proposal will rely on Paima Engine - a framework for creating web3 games, as it supports playing games using only standard message signing (no real transaction required). That means that if we have a safe and smooth flow for message signing, we can unlock a significantly better gaming experience.<br/><br/>\\n\\nNotably, the project consisted of the steps:\\n1.

Notably, zk cryptography, L2s and web3 gaming<br/><br/>\\n\\nSince these L2s and web3 gaming are both fairly high-frequency use-cases (transactions happen often), solutions like IPFS are not well equipped to store and pin all the different files. A common solution to this is to use a \u201cData Availability Layer\u201d (DA Layer) such as Celestia or Avail that is optimized for these kinds of use-cases. However, using a DA Layer comes with a disadvantage because you have to trust the DA layer to function properly, and is generally more expensive and slower than posting the data directly to the underlying L1<br/><br/>\\n\\nTo tackle this problem in Paima, we propose allowing games and apps using Paima to use \u201cVolitions\u201d, which try to get the best of both worlds. They allow users to choose in which case they post their data directly on the L1, and in which case they post their data on the DA Layer. This allows clients to optimize for the best experience<br/><br/>\\n\\nNotably, we plan to integrate Avail Project (https://www.availproject.org/) first as we believe they have the highest synergy with the Cardano ecosystem: they are based on Polkadot (whose underlying consensus is inspired by Ouroboros), and they have invested in a research-based approach working with new primitives like Coded Merkel Trees ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thdxHtQgszk)) to make their technology competitive<br/><br/>\\n\\nNotably, the plan for integration will have the following steps:\\n- Enable Paima to follow both the settlement layer and the DA light client at the same time\\n- Allow a way for clients to choose whether or not data gets posted to the settlement layer or the DA layer\\n- Allow merging L1 and DA layer data into a single stream for Paima apps to handle\\n\\n\\n\\n  </div>\\n</details>\\n\\nIdeascale: [link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/107691)<br />\\nLidonation: [link](https://www.lidonation.com/proposals/enable-apps-and-games-that-require-large-amounts-of-data-to-function-cheaply-while-still-maximizing-availability-and-safety-f10)\\n\\n### Paima\u3068Zeko\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u3084\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067zk\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\\n\u82f1\u8a9e\u540d\uff1aEnable apps and games built in the Cardano ecosystem to leverage ZK cryptography for privacy and scalability<br />\\nCost: ~100K USD\\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>Proposal summary</summary>\\n  <div>\\nCurrently many companies are looking into blockchain adoption for use-cases like commemorative NFTs point systems, DID, traceability and more. However, all of these require private data to avoid GDPR violations, which make them hard to manage with open systems like blockchains. Similarly, a lot of decentralized games are interested in similar concepts as they allow building games with information asymmetry like fog-of-war which is an important game mechanic. Additionally, the verifiability of ZK proofs also means that these could eventually be used to cheaply implement DeFi-focused components to games written with Paima (things that resemble casinos)<br/><br/>\\n\\nCurrently there is no good way to build these use-cases in the Cardano ecosystem, but fortunately Paima Engine (a framework for creating web3 apps and games) has a fairly clear path to adding these primitives. Notably, as a L2 solution, it has a lot more flexibility in adding new cryptographic primitives which are always hard to add directly to the Cardano L1<br/><br/>\\n\\nPaima Engine allows writing onchain apps with Javascript, making them fairly easy to write for all developers. For the ZK circuit component, we\u2019ve decided to partner with ZekoLabs. The reason is because they also allow writing ZK circuits in Javascript (so it feels like a unified experience for developers), and their system is based on Mina which is also compatible with Ouroboros and so it is a friendly project towards the Cardano community<br/><br/>\\n\\nNotably, the plan for integration will have the following steps:\\n- Allow running ZK proofs locally and associating their results to Stateful NFTs. \\n- Allow monitoring ZK appchains and merging their state into a Paima app\\n\\n\\n\\n  </div>\\n</details>\\n\\nIdeascale: [link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/107706)<br />\\nLidonation: [link](https://www.lidonation.com/proposals/enable-apps-and-games-built-in-the-cardano-ecosystem-to-leverage-zk-cryptography-for-privacy-and-scalability-f10)\\n\\n### NFT\u5185\u306e\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u5909\u5316\u3055\u305b\u3064\u3064\u58f2\u5374\u3082\u5bb9\u6613\u306b\u53ef\u80fd\u306aNFT\u958b\u767a\\n\u82f1\u8a9e\u540d\uff1aSupport Stateful NFTs (dynamic NFTs) for gaming in NFT marketplaces<br />\\nCost: ~100K USD\\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>Proposal summary</summary>\\n  <div>\\nStateful NFTs can be really complex.

It is proven to be of great adoption in the majority of the EVM compatible blockchains, with more than 6.5M POAPs already minted. Believe it or not, this is only 2M less than the ENTIRE NFT ecosystem in Cardano!<br/><br/>\\n\\nMore concretely, users would receive a single Stateful Proof of Attendance NFT (SPOAP NFT) that starts out blank, and every time they participate in an event, they would get a new commemorative NFT embedded inside their SPoA. If they\'ve ever received a single SPoA in their entire lifetime, event organizers will not have to mint them a new one which means the more users participate in the protocol, the cheaper it will get to distribute NFTs.<br/><br/>\\n\\nAdditionally, to enable building soulbound NFTs, these NFTs will be minted on Milkomeda (Cardano sidechain). This has the added benefit that transaction fees are also significantly cheaper than the Cardano L1, allowing for much larger and more regular drops and also bypasses the min UTxO issue. Thanks to the Milkomeda\'s work on wrapped smart contracts, it\'s still possible for Cardano users to fully control their SPoA directly from any Cardano wallet (Nami/Eternl/Flint/etc) and will not require any new wallets to be installed for neither event organizers nor regular participants\\n\\n\\n\\n  </div>\\n</details>\\n\\nIdeascale: [link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/100932/)<br />\\nLidonation: [link](https://www.lidonation.com/proposals/open-source-poap-in-cardano-f10)\\n\\n### NFT\u306b\u5831\u916c\u984d\u3092\u8a18\u9332+\u5f8c\u307b\u3069\u305d\u306e\u984d\u3092\u30c9\u30ed\u30c3\u30d7\u53ef\u80fd\u306e\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\\n\u82f1\u8a9e\u540d\uff1aExtend NFT sale & drop tools to support dropping more complex assets as required for onchain games<br />\\nCost: ~115K USD\\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>Proposal summary</summary>\\n  <div>\\nIf we look at funding platforms like Kickstarter, there are often multiple tiers to each preorder with (often overlapping) rewards. Trying to handle all this complexity at the NFT sale tool level is not only extremely complicated, it often introduces regulatory issues as most NFT sale platforms do not support purchasing fungible tokens for regulatory reasons.<br/><br/>\\n\\nTo solve this, we will leverage Stateful NFTs created by Paima Engine. Notably, Stateful NFTs are NFTs that can evolve overtime based on user actions. We will use this to allow purchasing into preorders to receive a Stateful NFT which can later be redeemed in-game once the game is launched. This allows very flexible pre-order systems as the redemption logic and tokens do not have to be created at the time of sale (similar to Kickstarter)<br/><br/>\\n\\nNotably, the user flow will look at follows:\\n- User finds a game doing a pre-order on an NFT platform that they want to participate in\\n- They pay with ADA (or any other tokens the site supports) to buy into the pre-order, which uses Milkomeda wrapped smart contracts to credit them a Stateful NFT\\n- (optional) if they choose to add more money into the pre-order, their existing Stateful NFT will be updated\\n- Once the sale is over, use their Stateful NFT to claim their in-game reward once the game is release\\n\\nWe may work with Plutus Art for the first implementation, but we reserve the right to change partners depending on factors such as their availability\\n\\n\\n\\n  </div>\\n</details>\\n\\nIdeascale: [link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/107533)<br />\\nLidonation: [link](https://www.lidonation.com/proposals/extend-nft-sale-drop-tools-to-support-dropping-more-complex-assets-as-required-for-onchain-games-f10)\\n\\n### \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u5b9f\u7e3e\u306e\u6a19\u6e96\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3001\u305d\u308c\u3092\u6271\u3046\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\\n\u82f1\u8a9e\u540d\uff1aOpen standard for cross-game achievement system to gamify onchain participation<br />\\nCost: ~75K USD\\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>Proposal summary</summary>\\n  <div>\\nThe goal of an open standard for cross-game achievements should be that any website or app can choose to support the achievement system without having to rely on any central server, as opposed to existing achievement systems that are depend on a central party like XBox Live or PlayStation<br/><br/>\\n\\nTo create an open cross-chain achievement standard we have a few requirements:\\n- Achievements for a game can have in-game effects (ex: a game can unlock an in-game area if you have 5+ achievements unlocked).

The dcSpark team were some of the initial contributors to SigmaUSD (the precursor to Djed), and Djed has been a pioneer in Milkomeda functionality by being an early adopter of new technologies like wrapped smart contracts.\\n\\nThis implementation of a stablecoin protocol on Milkomeda is based on the Osiris version of Djed, which improves the Minimal version by allowing the sale of reservecoins even when the reserve ratio is below the minimum threshold, provided that stablecoins are simultaneously sold in a proportion that increases the reserve ratio. This makes it easier for the reserve ratio to recover and for the peg in secondary markets to be restored even in situations where the demand for stablecoins is high and the demand for reservecoins is low following a price shock (a situation that is currently affecting SigmaUSD and COTI\'s Djed, making them trade above the peg at secondary markets). This version also introduces maximum transaction limits, in order to reduce the wholesale discount effect described in the paper.\\n\\n\\n\\n  </div>\\n</details>\\n\\nIdeascale: [link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/105933)<br />\\nLidonation: [link](https://www.lidonation.com/proposals/djed-osiris-stablecoin-on-cardanos-evm-sidechain-milkomeda-f10)\\n\\n### Treasure Chain\\nCost: ~68K USD\\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>Proposal summary</summary>\\n  <div>\\n\\n**Relation to Paima**: Treasure Chain will be utilizing Paima for part of their project, including the Godot integration Catalyst proposal you can find above\\n\\nTreasure Chain is a different kind of game that combines these three things.\\n\\n1. It is an NFT Art network where users keep NFT artworks called Tiles in a Deck, and can arrange them on a Map however they like. When minting an NFT using the platform, users can assign rules (called Linkages) about where it can sit on the map, what art can be contained within other art, and what art it can combine with to form new art.\\n2. These Linkages are modular and can be combined in different ways. They can form a sort of neural network of art where artists can create games and collaborative worlds together.\\n3. All transactions are done in crypto so users can profit from their creations and contributions. It is part game engine, part social media platform. Instead of relying on one specific art style for a game to receive mass adoption, since all artwork is user-created, players can collect and interact with only artwork they enjoy.\\n\\n\\n\\n  </div>\\n</details>\\n\\nIdeascale: [link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/101804)<br />\\nLidonation: [link](https://www.lidonation.com/proposals/treasure-chain-f10)\\n\\n### Open source Marketplace \u201cOpensea-like\u201d for MIlkomeda usecases and Seedstars Galaxy\\nCost: ~87K USD\\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>Proposal summary</summary>\\n  <div>\\n\\n**Relation to Paima**: Smart Chain plans to use Paima for their application\\n\\nSeedstars is conceptualizing its first impact NFT, the Seedstars NFT provides impact contributors with an opportunity to support the impact of early-stage tech companies selected and backed by trustable VC funds.
