unlock the next wave of innovation for the Cardano ecosystem by building new core infrastructure we think is both unique and will help pave a path for future success of the Cardano ecosystem.</p><p>dcSpark has been one of the most reliable companies for completing Catalyst grant proposals. Despite dcSpark only account for only about 1% of all proposals, we represent about 5~10% of all completed proposals - demonstrating our ability to deliver on our promises</p><p>True to our goal of being ecosystem builders, we have contributed to many things from core infrastructure, sidechains, open-source smart contracts, specifications and user-facing products. This time, however, we&#x27;ve decided to put all our efforts into <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlaXTJObDJk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">autonomous worlds</a></b>, onchain gaming and gamification</p><p>Notably, we believe that through <a href="https://twitter.com/paimastudios" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paima Engine</a>, we have the ability to build the most competitive platform in all of crypto and be the global leader in one of the fastest growing segments in Web3.</p><p>However, if you&#x27;ve looked more into Paima (such as in our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtvemijxF-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Youtube explained</a>), you&#x27;ll notice that although Paima is building in the Cardano ecosystem, that the technology can (and inevitably will) be used on different chains as well. We&#x27;re big believers in aligning incentives, and so we want to make sure that the success of Paima also means the success of everybody who has supported the team on the journey.</p><p>To explain how we plan to align incentives, first we have to talk about the business model of Paima: it is similar to a game engine. That is to say, it&#x27;s free to use, but using Paima for commercial purposes and crossing a revenue threshold means you have to pay. The long-term goal is to DAOify Paima in the future. Although the exact fee system may change over time, our proposal is to <strong>give a discount to any project using Paima to deploy their app in the Cardano ecosystem</strong>. That is to say, if for example you have to pay a 7% royalty for revenue crossing the threshold when deploying your game to Ethereum, you would only (for example) have to pay 3.5% when deploying in the Cardano ecosystem. To put it more formally, Paima will reduce any costs for projects deploying in Cardano up to 50% pro-rated depending on how many of our proposals pass. If 100% of our proposals pass, the reduction will be 50%. If only Â½ of our proposals pass, the reduction will only be 25%.</p><p>We believe this system will strongly align the two ecosystems together. It allows us to very easily pitch Cardano as the best ecosystem for projects planning to use Paima, not just thanks to the lower royalty costs, but also thanks to the fact that Paima will support Cardano NFTs which are generally much safer to work with than ERC721 tokens while being secured by one of the most decentralized blockchains. We hope you&#x27;re as excited about the potential of Autonomous Worlds and Paima as we are, and look forward to building a strong ecosystem, together.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="proposal-ranking">Proposal ranking<a href="#proposal-ranking" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Proposal ranking" title="Direct link to Proposal ranking">â</a></h3><p>We have many proposals and of course we really appreciate those who support all of them. However, if you want to read or support part of our proposals, we have split them up into four categories to help you prioritize:</p><ol><li><strong>Core</strong>: proposals that we believe are core to the success of Paima</li><li><strong>Extended</strong>: proposals that makes it easier to onboard people and companies to Paima</li><li><strong>Supplement</strong>: proposals that help Paima if they pass, but are not proposals we will actively market</li><li><strong>Partner</strong>: proposals that are not made by dcSpark, but by our partners (these will <strong>not</strong> count towards the discount mentioned above)</li></ol><h1>How to quickly vote on all proposals</h1><p>Unfortunately, the Catalyst app search feature is not very good.

However, a lot of users lose interest when they realize how tedious it will be to accept the prompt by their wallet every time they have to sign a message<br><br><p>As the authors of original Cardano message signing spec (CIP8: <a href="https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip8/</a>), we are very familiar with the cryptography involved in message signing. We are planning to release a layer on top of this message signing system to more easily allow wallets to auto-sign messages in cases where it knows it is safe to do so. Although we will create a more formal specification, you can find the initial approaches discussed in the following document: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VqXjyfgvbXxYHqhzYcSFFEorYbnza6GbjyAbVXyAKAM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a><br><br></p><p>Notably, a lot of the power of this proposal will rely on Paima Engine - a framework for creating web3 games, as it supports playing games using only standard message signing (no real transaction required).

Notably, zk cryptography, L2s and web3 gaming<br><br><p>Since these L2s and web3 gaming are both fairly high-frequency use-cases (transactions happen often), solutions like IPFS are not well equipped to store and pin all the different files. A common solution to this is to use a âData Availability Layerâ (DA Layer) such as Celestia or Avail that is optimized for these kinds of use-cases. However, using a DA Layer comes with a disadvantage because you have to trust the DA layer to function properly, and is generally more expensive and slower than posting the data directly to the underlying L1<br><br></p><p>To tackle this problem in Paima, we propose allowing games and apps using Paima to use âVolitionsâ, which try to get the best of both worlds.

However, all of these require private data to avoid GDPR violations, which make them hard to manage with open systems like blockchains. Similarly, a lot of decentralized games are interested in similar concepts as they allow building games with information asymmetry like fog-of-war which is an important game mechanic. Additionally, the verifiability of ZK proofs also means that these could eventually be used to cheaply implement DeFi-focused components to games written with Paima (things that resemble casinos)<br><br><p>Currently there is no good way to build these use-cases in the Cardano ecosystem, but fortunately Paima Engine (a framework for creating web3 apps and games) has a fairly clear path to adding these primitives. Notably, as a L2 solution, it has a lot more flexibility in adding new cryptographic primitives which are always hard to add directly to the Cardano L1<br><br></p><p>Paima Engine allows writing onchain apps with Javascript, making them fairly easy to write for all developers. For the ZK circuit component, weâve decided to partner with ZekoLabs. The reason is because they also allow writing ZK circuits in Javascript (so it feels like a unified experience for developers), and their system is based on Mina which is also compatible with Ouroboros and so it is a friendly project towards the Cardano community<br><br></p><p>Notably, the plan for integration will have the following steps:</p><ul><li>Allow running ZK proofs locally and associating their results to Stateful NFTs. </li><li>Allow monitoring ZK appchains and merging their state into a Paima app</li></ul></div></div></div></details><p>Ideascale: <a href="https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/107706" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a><br>

Believe it or not, this is only 2M less than the ENTIRE NFT ecosystem in Cardano!<br><br><p>More concretely, users would receive a single Stateful Proof of Attendance NFT (SPOAP NFT) that starts out blank, and every time they participate in an event, they would get a new commemorative NFT embedded inside their SPoA. If they&#x27;ve ever received a single SPoA in their entire lifetime, event organizers will not have to mint them a new one which means the more users participate in the protocol, the cheaper it will get to distribute NFTs.<br><br></p><p>Additionally, to enable building soulbound NFTs, these NFTs will be minted on Milkomeda (Cardano sidechain). This has the added benefit that transaction fees are also significantly cheaper than the Cardano L1, allowing for much larger and more regular drops and also bypasses the min UTxO issue. Thanks to the Milkomeda&#x27;s work on wrapped smart contracts, it&#x27;s still possible for Cardano users to fully control their SPoA directly from any Cardano wallet (Nami/Eternl/Flint/etc) and will not require any new wallets to be installed for neither event organizers nor regular participants</p><p>If you like this proposal, you may also be interested in <a href="https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/103296" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this proposal</a> that is another approach to tackling this problem by some of the same partners as our POAP proposal.</p></div></div></div></details><p>Ideascale: <a href="https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/100932/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a><br>

This makes it easier for the reserve ratio to recover and for the peg in secondary markets to be restored even in situations where the demand for stablecoins is high and the demand for reservecoins is low following a price shock (a situation that is currently affecting SigmaUSD and COTI&#x27;s Djed, making them trade above the peg at secondary markets). This version also introduces maximum transaction limits, in order to reduce the wholesale discount effect described in the paper.</p></div></div></div></details><p>Ideascale: <a href="https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/105933" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a><br>

When minting an NFT using the platform, users can assign rules (called Linkages) about where it can sit on the map, what art can be contained within other art, and what art it can combine with to form new art.</li><li>These Linkages are modular and can be combined in different ways. They can form a sort of neural network of art where artists can create games and collaborative worlds together.</li><li>All transactions are done in crypto so users can profit from their creations and contributions. It is part game engine, part social media platform. Instead of relying on one specific art style for a game to receive mass adoption, since all artwork is user-created, players can collect and interact with only artwork they enjoy.</li></ol></div></div></div></details><p>Ideascale: <a href="https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/101804" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a><br>
